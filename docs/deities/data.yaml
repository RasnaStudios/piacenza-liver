  iscription_in_etruscan: tin/cil/en
  deity_name: Tinia
  roman_equivalent: Jupiter
  greek_equivalent: Zeus
  section_type: sky
  short_description: Supreme sky deity in Etruscan pantheon.
  long_description: >
    Tinia, the supreme sky god of the Etruscans, is often identified with the Roman Jupiter
    and the Greek Zeus. As the chief deity, Tinia holds dominion over the celestial domain,
    thunder, and divine will. The positioning of Tinia's name in the most prominent section
    of the liver model aligns with his overarching authority within the pantheon. His dual
    inscription (also found in sections 2 and 3) may emphasize different epithets or ritual aspects,
    possibly regional or functional variants. Tinia's role also connects directly to the
    ordering of time through celestial phenomena, as suggested by his association with
    solstitial and equinoctial markers and his presence in cosmological frameworks such
    as the Templum solare. Tinia's frequent presence on Etruscan artifacts underscores his
    importance in civic and cultic religious structures, particularly in defining sacred space
    and hierarchical celestial order in haruspicy.
  divination_meaning: Represents favorable signs from the upper heavens; linked to authority and cosmic order.
  hepatoscopy: Located in the outermost ring; associated with the timing of important astronomical events.
  ritual_associations: Linked with rites of state and solar calendrical festivals.
  archaeological_notes: Found in sector 1 of the outer ring on the Piacenza Liver; matches other appearances of Tinia in Etruscan votive artifacts.

  iscription_in_etruscan: uni/mae
  deity_name: Uni
  roman_equivalent: Juno
  greek_equivalent: Hera
  section_type: sky
  short_description: Principal goddess and consort of Tinia.
  long_description: >
    Uni, often aligned with the Roman Juno and the Greek Hera, is the consort of Tinia
    and presides over marriage, fertility, and social harmony. In Etruscan religion,
    Uni also held a strong civic role, often appearing in triads alongside Tinia and Menrva.
    Her inclusion in the celestial regions of the Piacenza liver model marks her high
    position in the divine hierarchy. The epithet /mae possibly indicates a maternal or
    generative attribute. The identification of Uni in this context reinforces the symbolic
    complementarity of male and female divine forces in Etruscan cosmology.
  divination_meaning: Omens related to protection of the community, fertility, and civic stability.
  archaeological_notes: Associated with inscriptions in sanctuaries and votive deposits, especially in Volsinii and Gravisca.

- section_number: 5
  iscription_in_etruscan: tec/vm
  deity_name: Tecvm
  section_type: infernal
  short_description: Possibly an underworld deity.
  long_description: >
    The deity Tecvm is attested only on the Piacenza Liver and has not been securely identified
    in other Etruscan sources. Its position among other deities of the infernal sphere suggests
    a chthonic role, possibly connected with ancestral or liminal functions in the cosmological
    mapping. The obscure nature of this name reflects the stratified, possibly localized pantheon
    preserved in ritual instruments.
  archaeological_notes: Only known occurrence on the Piacenza Liver.

- section_number: 6
  iscription_in_etruscan: lvsl
  deity_name: Lusal
  section_type: sky
  short_description: Possibly a celestial deity.
  long_description: >
    Lusal appears in several inscriptions, possibly connected to celestial or luminous forces.
    Some scholars propose a link to the Indo-European root *leuk-, suggesting brightness.
    The position in the outer ring may support a reading connected with solar or astral observation.
  archaeological_notes: Attested also in votive contexts near Chiusi.

- section_number: 7
  iscription_in_etruscan: neθ
  deity_name: Neθuns
  roman_equivalent: Neptune
  greek_equivalent: Poseidon
  section_type: aquatic
  short_description: Etruscan god of water and the sea.
  long_description: >
    Neθuns, appearing here as neθ, is the Etruscan god of fresh water, springs, and possibly the sea.
    He later corresponds to Neptune in the Roman pantheon and Poseidon in the Greek.
    While his marine functions were emphasized in Roman religion, Etruscan tradition appears to
    root him more firmly in sources of fresh and sacred water. His presence in the liver model
    suggests consultation of watery omens, perhaps linked with rainfall or purification rites.
  divination_meaning: Omens related to water, rain, floods, or purification.
  archaeological_notes: Inscriptions found in Tarquinia and on votive altars.

- section_number: 8
  iscription_in_etruscan: caθa
  deity_name: Catha
  section_type: celestial
  short_description: Liminal solar or lunar deity.
  long_description: >
    Catha is a mysterious figure in the Etruscan pantheon often interpreted as a solar or lunar
    deity associated with liminal phases like dawn or dusk. Frequently paired with Śuri in depictions
    and inscriptions, Catha symbolizes transitional illumination—important in divinatory contexts
    for signaling change or thresholds. Her name is attested on votive inscriptions and possibly linked
    to funerary rites involving solar journeys.
  divination_meaning: Sign of transitions, thresholds, or changes in cycle.
  archaeological_notes: Mentioned in votive texts from Pyrgi and associated with solar cult contexts.

  iscription_in_etruscan: leθam
  deity_name: Leθam
  section_type: infernal
  short_description: Possibly an ancestral or underworld spirit.
  long_description: >
    Leθam is otherwise unattested in known Etruscan texts, but its placement within the infernal
    quadrant of the liver model suggests a connection with the chthonic realm or spirits of the dead.
    Its proximity to more defined underworld figures supports a hypothesis of ancestral invocation.
  archaeological_notes: Known only from this liver inscription.

  iscription_in_etruscan: fuflunsl
  deity_name: Fufluns
  roman_equivalent: Bacchus
  greek_equivalent: Dionysus
  section_type: chthonic/vital
  short_description: God of vegetation, rebirth, and ecstatic rites.
  long_description: >
    Fufluns is the Etruscan equivalent of Dionysus, though his attributes also include rebirth,
    healing, and vegetation. His cult appears associated with vital force and regenerative power,
    including chthonic dimensions like return from death or fertility of the earth. He appears
    frequently in funerary art and mirrors, often shown youthful and crowned in ivy.
  divination_meaning: Omens of renewal, fertility, or ecstatic transformation.
  archaeological_notes: Widely represented in tomb paintings, bronze mirrors, and votive gifts.

# Piacenza Liver - 3D Interactive Visualization

An interactive 3D visualization of the ancient Etruscan Piacenza Liver (Fegato di Piacenza), a bronze model used for divination that maps the cosmological structure of Etruscan religious beliefs. This project presents all 42 authentic Etruscan inscriptions with scholarly annotations following the Maggiani-Gottarelli cosmological framework.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive 3D Model**: Navigate around the bronze liver model with mouse/touch controls
- **Authentic Etruscan Script**: All 42 inscriptions displayed in original Etruscan Unicode characters (𐌀-𐌚)
- **Scholarly Annotations**: Comprehensive deity information, divination meanings, and archaeological notes
- **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive design with touch controls and performance optimizations
- **Cosmological Grouping**: Organized by the six structural groups (A-G) of the liver's layout

## 🏛️ About the Piacenza Liver

The Piacenza Liver is a bronze model dating to the late 2nd or early 1st century BCE, discovered near Piacenza, Italy in 1877. It served as a guide for Etruscan haruspices (diviners) who interpreted the will of the gods by examining sheep livers. The model maps the Etruscan cosmos onto 42 sections, each dedicated to specific deities.
